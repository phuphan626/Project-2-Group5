                                        Since the advent of the scorecard in the 1870’s the game of baseball has forever been tied to statistics. 
                                        Keeping score was a way for fans and enthusiasts to relive the game by paying attention to each and every event on the field. 
                                        As technology progressed and stats were posted on the jumbotron for the entire ballpark to see, manual score-keeping gradually lost popularity, 
                                        but the marriage between statistics and baseball was solidified forever. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Analysis of baseball statistics has been performed by team owners, managers 
                                        and fans since the 1940’s to gain an edge on the competition. With the rise of <a href = "https://sabr.org/sabermetrics">Sabermetrics</a> and 
                                        the Oakland A’s <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Oakland_Athletics_season">historic season</a> in the early 2000's, 
                                        the collection and analysis of baseball statistics took on a whole new meaning: smaller, underfunded teams could take on the established powerhouses by 
                                        the careful and nuanced application of empirical analysis. Fast forward to 2020 and every single team has a robust analytics department that plays a major 
                                        role in the teams overall strategy, as well as day to day game planning. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In this project we analyzed the changes in a few key batting and pitching metrics and visualized these changes over time. We also analyzed the stats before and after Sabermetrics became widely popular to explore how
                                        analytics changed the game. To do this, we used <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a> to web-scrape Baseball Reference's 
                                        historical data for several key <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/bat.shtml">batting</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/pitch.shtml">pitching</a> metrics. 
                                        Once the data was extracted and transformed, we loaded it into a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> relational database.
                                        We then used <a href = "https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> to serve the connection between our database and visualizations. Our interactive visualizations were made using <a href = "https://www.chartjs.org">Charts.js and D3.js</a>. 
                                        The dynamic visualizations we created give us a good picture of the ever changing game of baseball from a statistical perspective. Explore our vizualizations by clicking through the navigation bar on the left side of the page.
